# Development Guide

## Helpful vscode extensions:

Install and follow whatever installation instructions provided in the extension

1. [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

- Right click on a HTML file and select "Open With Live Sever"

2. [HTML Hints](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HTMLHint.vscode-htmlhint)

- Helps with identifying syntax mistakes in html code and CSS (iirc)

## Development Process

### Git and GitHub

- WORK IN YOUR OWN BRANCHES
- Use Github pull requests to submit code
- Pull from main and merge main into your own branch frequently, ESPECIALLY before pull requests

### Running and Working on files

- Use the Live Server extension to run the page, you will be able to see updates in real time

(or i guess use the default debugging that vscode provides for html, but i dont trust it much :| )

- Place new CSS styles in `/css/main.css`
- Feel free to add new classes or IDs, but please don't touch any of the preexisting ones
